The diversity of thistle fruit flies;For decades, a loss of biodiversity has been observed all over the world. Extinction of species endangers the animal and plant community and, according to prognoses, could lead to a collapse of ecosystems worldwide. The interdependence of the animal and plant world is particularly evident on the example of insects. However, just one third of all insect species have been described, which means that a large number of them is threatened with extinction in the shadows.
