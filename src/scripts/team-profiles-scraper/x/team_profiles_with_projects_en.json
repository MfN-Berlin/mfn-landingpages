My research is based both on field work and on data-mining of global Phanerozoic-scale data bases, particularly the Paleobiology Database. A special focus is on marine bivalves because they exhibit an excellent fossil record, and because their ecological variety allows an accordingly refined interpretation of palaeontological and geological problems. My taxonomic work concentrates on marine bivalves from the Jurassic period. Research projects Is vision in marine invertebrates associated with evolutionary success?

    "profile_projects": "In my project, I study amber inclusions of seed plants from the Cretaceous to the Cenozoic of East Asia. In the past years, East Asian amber deposits of Myanmar (mid-Cretaceous), Fushun (China, early Eocene) and Zhangpu (China, middle Miocene) revealed a tremendously increasing number of inclusions, however, research interests were mainly focused on arthropod, other invertebrate and even vertebrate inclusions. Fossil seed plants from these East Asian ambers are still virtually unstudied. Thus, source forests of East Asian ambers have been basically interpreted on the basis of arthropod inclusions, leading to contradictory results. By investigating these fossil plants, I aim to reconstruct the amber source forests of Myanmar, Fushun and Zhangpu deposits. I use light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and three-dimensional X-ray microscopy (microCT and synchrotron) for the morphological-anatomical investigation and the taxonomic classification of the inclusions. Then, I will compare the found plant taxa to fossil and extant analogous taxa to have a better understanding of their palaeoecological requirements. I will use this information to reconstruct the vegetation of the East Asian amber floras, the habitat types and the structure of their source forests. This is relevant for a profound palaeoecological evaluation of the plethora of invertebrates and vertebrate inclusions recovered from these ambers. Furthermore, my study has the potential to provide significant keys for understanding terrestrial palaeoecosystems of East Asia and their evolution in time and space, as well as palaeobiogeographic patterns and the evolutionary history of specific plant lineages.; Plant inclusions in amber Evolution of seed plants Reconstruction of Mesozoic and Cenozoic palaeoenvironments and palaeoclimate Mesozoic fossil wood anatomy, taxonomy, palaeobiogeography",

My research focuses on the patterns of diversification, phylogeny, and paleobiology of one of the two major clades of amniotes, the Synapsida, the clade that ultimately led to the evolution of mammals. The application of a number of different approaches combines paleontological fieldwork with modern techniques (3D-imaging) and quantitative methods to shed new light on the initial patterns of diversification of synapsids, the transition from early forms to therapsids (including mammals) and the acquisition of key mammalian features. Ultimately, my research aims to quantitatively investigate trends in the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems, such as in their complexity, as well as to gain a better understanding of the impact of mass extinction events on terrestrial ecosystems, with the focus on the vertebrate fauna.

I use an integrative approach that combines data from extant taxa and the fossil record to develop a broad perspective for the evolutionary history of amphibians through deep time. Therein, the combined study of developmental patterns and processes in crown group amphibians and fossil taxa offers the unique possibility to gain an understanding for the evolution of developmental pathways and the acquisition of the derived morphologies seen in modern forms.",

For this purpose, various methods are employed to evaluate the ecological, economic, and social functions of forests and to monitor changes in ecosystems. To ensure effective monitoring, it is essential to comprehensively record all relevant aspects of biodiversity in the forest. One promising method for surveying species that produce sounds is the use of (bio)acoustic methods.",

    "profile_projects": "NSB: the Berlin version of the Neptune Deep-Sea Microfossil Occurrence Database Micropaleontologic study of deep-sea sediments cored over several decades by the DSDP, ODP and IODP drilling programs has yielded a vast body of information on the occurrences of individual fossil marine plankton species over time. This information also has been combined with other types of geochronologic information by interdisciplinary teams of scientists to construct detailed age estimates - age models - for hundreds of deep-sea drilling sections. Together, this information provides a uniquely detailed history of of biologic evolution in the oceans, as well as an important source of geochronologic information for geologic studies of ocean and climate change. The NSB database (www.nsb-mfn-berlin.de) provides integrated access to this global data-set. It contains over 700,000 records for the occurrences of species in individual, numerically age-dated samples, age models for hundreds of deep-sea sections, and extensive, annotated, quality-controlled taxonomic lists for thousands of fossil marine plankton species, the latter in part created by earlier MfN-led projects (e.g., the IODP funded Paleontology Coordination Group effort). Neptune, or analyses from it, has been cited in ca 80 research papers, including 8 in Science, Nature or PNAS. Neptune was originally created by a team led by me in the early 1990s at the ETH in Zürich, and re-cast in internet form, with the addition of more data, by the Chronos project of NSF in the early 2000s. In response to the lapse of Chronos and support for Neptune, I teamed up with Patrick Diver, the main Chronos database programmer, to create a new version of Neptune (Neptune Sandbox Berlin, or NSB) that is hosted at the Museum für Naturkunde. Extensive reprogramming has streamlined the system so that it is easier to maintain, and includes support for direct programmable access over the internet for advanced research purposes. This project was supported by CEES, Oslo.  The European Science Foundation/Earthtime-EU project provided funds a few years ago to further extend the database content, in particular adding extensive geochronologic data for the cored sections, and general information on marine geochronology.  In recent years, Dr. Johan Renaudie (MfN Berlin) has taken the lead in further developing the database and the website. NSB is a central research tool within my own group, and provides data to external scientists via the website, and by webservices (e.g. occurrence data summaries to mikrotax.org). Anyone interested in using the database can get a free account by contacting either Johan Renaudie (johan.renaudie@mfn-berlin.de) or me. Micropaleontological Reference Centers (MRC) Network Since 1968, deep-sea drilling ships have recovered sediment cores from all the major ocean basins. This wealth of deep-sea material has yielded a unique record of biologic evolution in the form of abundant preserved skeletons of marine microfossils. These fossils are important for synthesising larger scale patterns of plankton evolution, to determine the geologic age of sediments and are key recorders of past environmental change. The Micropaleontological Reference Centers (MRCs) have been developed over a 30 year period to provide a scientific collection of this microfossil record. Maintained by curators at over a dozen sites around the world, the Micropaleontological Reference Centers provide scientists with an opportunity to examine microfossils of various geologic ages, and from a globally distributed set of locations. The collections, with more than 20,000 samples, cover four microfossil groups—calcareous nannofossils, foraminifers, radiolarians, and diatoms—selected from sediment cores obtained from the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP), the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP), and the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP). The MRCs are a source of materials for current research and are a legacy archive for deep sea drilling. The MRCs also accept selected \"orphaned\" collections of deep-sea microfossil materials. The organization is supervised by a lead curator (currently me) together with the other scientists that make up the MRC network. See the MRC homepage for more information. WoRMS Living Polycystine Radiolarian Species List The World Register of Marine Species project (www.marinespecies.org) is a cooperative effort by hundreds of scientists to create and maintain accurate, comprehensive lists of marine organisms.  I maintain the list (currently about 400 species) for the Polycystina, the group of radiolarians that create the vast majority of siliceous, fossil forming skeletons.  The content of this list is kept in sync with the larger list including fossil forms found in NSB.; Research interests Virtually all areas of micropaleontologic research (taxonomy, biostratigraphy, paleoceanography, paleobiology) Taxonomic expertise is in Cenozoic radiolarians Methodologies tend to be very quantitative, data-oriented and computer-based: morphometrics, databases (particularly the marine microfossil Neptune db system), digital imaging, multivariate statistics, often with software development.

    "profile_projects": "In the field of paleobotany I am investigating fossil plants of the late Paleozoic era and their environment. At the end of this era (c. 320-250 million years ago), land ecosystems underwent distinct changes in response to major tectonic and paleoclimatic processes on Earth (e.g., Late Paleozoic Ice Age). Global change also affected vegetational composition at this time. Wet tropical forests were replaced by seasonally dry vegetation communities, composed of drought resistent plants. On the one hand, my scientific work is dedicated to fossil plants as climate archives to learn more about environmental conditions, at this time. For this, I use well-known methods, such as dendroecology, but also apply recent botanical methods to fossil plants and try to further develop them (e.g., water conductivity and gas exchange capacity). On the other hand, I am investigating fossil plants of the late Paleozoic with regard to evolution in response to global change. Recently, I am focussing on a group of seed ferns (Medullosales). These extinct plants possess enigmatic stem constructions which is rarely found in the plant kingdom. Research on these plants means to learn something about plant functionality (plant architecture and survival strategies), but also about the evolution of seed plants, in general. By forcing interdisciplinary work that combining the fields of paleontology and geology, I aim to reconstruct whole ecosystems of the late Paleozoic to understand interactions of atmosphere, geosphere and biosphere.",

I am particularly interested in selective forces affecting dispersal and in mechanisms that restrict gene flow among populations.My empirical studies involve bats and grasshoppers especially in Palaearctic and Neotropic regions and combine different methodological approaches including behavioural, ecological, morphological and genetic techniques.

Little is known from fossils about the evolution of symbiosis (= commensalism, parasitism and mutualism) over geological timescales. How do parasites influence host evolution? What are the origins of parasitic life histories? How do symbionts escape from host extinction? These problems, extensively studied by parasitologists, remain virtually untouched in palaeontology. The fossil holasteroid sea urchin Echinocorys can be used as a model taxon to study various aspects of symbiosis in deep time. It is a long-ranging taxon (Cenomanian-Thanetian) which survived the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. Echinocorys was widespread and often dominated the soft-bottom communities. Moreover, its large size and assumed longevity favoured encounters with symbionts. Its availability in many collections makes the fossil echinoid Echinocorys a prime candidate for the examination of traces produced by symbiotic organisms.

These are compared to current conservation schemes (protected areas) and possible threats (e.g. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis). The niche modelling approach is extended into the future to evaluate the impact of different climate change scenarios. This work was part of the BIOTA West project. At the MfN it is located within the working group of Mark-Oliver Rödel and cross linked with other projects. Parts of the work are conducted in collaboration with the Technical University Berlin with support from the HPI Future SOC Lab in Postdam and the Humboldt University Berlin.

    "profile_projects": "Something on the Petropedetes natator complex & the Conraua alleni complex (Michael Barej) Amphibian communities within changing environments (Joseph Doumbia): Within the World Heritage Site Nimba Mountains, it is examined how amphibian communities change along mountainous rivers under increasing anthropogenic pressure (increasing agriculture, increasing population and mining). Of particular interest are changes over time of the amphibian communities and the influence of environmental parameters on particular species as well as on the communities as a whole. Adaptation potential of selected amphibian species in relation to climate change impacts (Carolin Dittrich): studies via literature research, empirical and experimental field data the adaptive potential of native amphibians to expected changes of temperature and water availability. Main focus are transfer-experiments, where eggs of the yellow-bellied toad (Bombina variegata) are interchanged between different habitat types and developmental parameters are compared. [Link] Surviving in changing environments - plastic responses or genetic stereotypes? Studies on a population of the common frog in southern Germany (Franziska Grözinger): studies the adaptive potential of a population of the common frog (Rana temporaria) in southern Germany. There, she investigates the cause of the observed differences in developmental traits: are they based on plastic reactions to environmental conditions or are there certain mechanisms leading to a genetic specialization on local scale? [Link] Life-history traits and extinction probabilities in changing environments – montane amphibians in Cameroon as model systems (Mareike Hirschfeld): This project aims to analyse if ecological properties (e.g. distribution, reproductive mode, reproduction potential, and trophic niche) are able to predict a species’ specific adaptation potential. Additionally, we hope to identify phylogenetic independent traits which facilitate and / or constrain species’ adaptation to current or future habitat and climate alterations. [Link] The effect of matrix quality in a fragmented landscape using a hyperdiverse Malagasy amphibian assemblage as an example (Serge Ndriantsoa): investigates the suitability of different types of matrix habitat (deforested land, i.e., rice fields, banana plantations, secondary vegetation) for migration of frogs (influencing frog diversity in forest fragments), and as valuable habitat for some species in the surroundings of Ranomafana National Park (Madagascar). This study aims at identifying important drivers of amphibian community structure in highly fragmented landscapes. Macroecology of West African amphibians (Johannes Penner): investigates the distribution of amphibians and the reasons behind that. The observed patterns are augmented by results from fine grained environmental niche modeling. [Link] Functional consequences of biodiversity loss and fragmentation on ecosystems using a hyperdiverse Malagasy amphibian assemblage as an example (Jana Riemann): investigates the effects of forest fragmentation on species richness, community composition, functional diversity and trophic position of frogs in the Ranomafana National Park and its surroundings (Madagascar). This study aims at understanding how local extinctions depend on functional components of diversity, food web properties and species’ phylogenetic distance, and further, how patterns of amphibian diversity depend on fragmentation related properties of amphibian habitat like forest fragment size and isolation. [Link] Living on the cutting edge? (Laura Sandberger): The Nimba toad – Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis - the only truly viviparous amphibian on Earth, is endemic to the high altitude grasslands of the Nimba Mountains. It is examined what the drivers for the toad’s patchy distribution within a seemingly homogenous habitat are, how the past and present connectivity and metapopulation dynamics develop and the abundances with increasing anthropogenic pressure are monitored. [Link] Management options for amphibian conservation under climate change influences (Nadine Zacharias): reviews within the Habit-Change project behaviour and habitat requirements of selected European amphibian species with a special focus on climate changing impacts. Finally, this will lead towards recommendations for adaptive management plans for protected areas in Eastern Europe, which should incorporate the reduction of climate change stress for amphibians. [Link] [Habit-Change] Amphibian diversity and genetic connectivity along altitudinal and disturbance gradients on Mt. Kilimanjaro (Tanzania) (Giulia Zancolli): the study focuses on how the landscape affects amphibian diversity at different levels, from the species to the genes. First assay patterns of species richness and assemblage composition along the southern slope of Mt. Kilimanjaro are studied and compared to other Tanzanian mountains. Secondly, the question is pursued how topographic features, e.g. elevation, slope, vegetation type affect the connectivity and genetic variation of two non-model anuran species which are closely related (genus Amietia) but differ in altitudinal distribution. Finally, loci involved in the adaptation to altitude are identified, using a population genomics approach. [Link]; The main research goal of my working group is to understand species and species community responses to changing environments, such as climate change or logging, unsustainable use of natural resources and disease. My main, but non-exclusive, study organisms are amphibians and reptiles. In order to have a sound baseline for all our ecological and macro-ecological research, I am also researching the faunistics, taxonomy, phylo-biogeography of species, manly those from Africa. We apply a wide array of methods comprising e.g. empirical and experimental lab and field studies, modelling, morphological, anatomical, genetic, bioacoustics and biochemical approaches. The working group comprises bachelor, master and PhD students (and Post-Docs) from around the world, in particular, including people from those (tropical) countries were we conduct our research. Thus we aim at strengthening the research capacity in these countries and to deliver important data, helping to assure the long-term survival of the biodiversity we study.; Long-term project on population dynamics, ecology and behavior of common frogs and fire salamanders in Steigerwald, Bavaria (since 2005) Long-term project on population dynamics of the viviparous Nimba toad and riverine amphibians on Mount Nimba, Guinea (since 2006) Long-term community responses of amphibians to changes in rainforest and savanna habitats (i.e. Tai National Park and Comoé National Park, Ivory Coast, since 1999 and 1992, respectively) Systematics, taxonomy, biogeography and macroecology of African amphibians and reptiles Food-web restoration in an Ecuadorian rainforest (part of DFG-Forschungsgruppe 5207)",

I use fossil and extant plant material in order to understand the morphological-anatomical evolution of plants from the Mesozoic to the Recent. Specifically, I am focused on the evolution of terrestrial palaeoecosystems and their biodiversity through time and space. By using plant fossils, I aim to reconstruct habitats, their structure and climate, as well as palaeoecological interactions. This gives new insights into how biodiversity and the environment changed in the past and which processes caused these changes. Moreover, fossil floras help to understand distribution changes of specific plant lineages, as well as the biogeographic and climatic causes. My research is primarily focused on inclusions in amber (fossilized resin), which is a valuable source for exquisitely, three-dimensionally preserved plant organs. I study these plant inclusions with standard light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and new state-of-the-art X-ray based imaging techniques. I use identified plant taxa as indicators for specific habitat types and structure, as well as for the paleoclimate, facilitating the reconstruction of the ‘amber forests’ the amber derives from.; Evolution of terrestrial palaeoecosystems in the Cretaceous and Cenozoic Reconstruction of palaeoecosystems: habitats, structure, vegetation, diversity, climate Evolutionary morphology of seed plants Evolution and systematics of seed plants Biogeography of seed plants Lab website (MfN)",

(1) I develop bioinformatic tools and employ cutting-edge technologies such as Nanopore for species discovery. A key focus has been to develop user friendly tools for large scale NGS barcoding projects, such as ONTbarcoder to obtain accurate consensus barcodes using nanopore sequencing. (2) I furthermore use metagenomics and metabarcoding to characterize species interactions using different types of environmental samples. This allows us to study the diet, parasites and microbiomes and provide valuable insights into the complex relationships between species and their surrounding environment.",

    "role": "I am an anthropologist of knowledge with a particular interest in transformations, controversies, and epistemic shifts within techno-scientific communities and societies at large. After completing my Ph.D. on the value transformation of DIY skills and engineering knowledge in late Soviet and post-Soviet Russian society, I worked on a scientific controversy in contemporary evolutionary biology and on epistemic shifts in European space policy. More recently, I have been working on the role of artists in creating alternative narratives about technological futures. I am particularly interested in how meanings and values are ascribed to knowledge, and how the ways in which knowledge is ordered and practiced can shift, evolve, and be contested as a result of political, economic, and social transformations. Before joining the MfN, I worked as a postdoc at the Department of STS at the Technical University of Munich (2018-2023) and as a Ph.D. candidate at the Institute of Anthropology at the University of Neuchatel (2011-2013, completed in 2019). I enjoyed being a visiting scholar at the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley in 2016, and at the Leibniz-Institut für Länderkunde, Leipzig in 2017. From 2013 to 2015, I served as the executive director of the project “Russian Computer Scientists at Home and Abroad” at the STS Center of the European University in St. Petersburg. In the IETI project, I am researching how the MfN as an institution understands, practices, and evaluates its institutional and social impact, with the goal of proposing a more long-term and reflexive methodology for public engagement in museums.",

Focussing on molluscs and crustaceans, we use integrative taxonomy to establish a baseline for follow-up research on the phylo- and biogeography of species and higher taxa as well as in-depth studies on speciation, especially in ancient lakes. To this purpose, we employ morphological (e.g., light microscopy, SEM, µCT, histology) as well as genetic (molecular phylogenetics, transcriptomics, phylogenomics) methods. International collaboration is an important part of our research, with long-term partnerships established with countries in SE Asia (Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam) and W Africa (Cameroon).
